## WiFi socket lights server
This is a ghetto home-automation setup where all WiFi plug sockets with 'hs100' in the name in the hosts file can be
turned on and off my making requests to `home/lights/on` and `home/lights/off`. This allows it to be used in an IFTTT
setup with Google Assistant.

[The hs100](http://www.tp-link.com/us/products/details/HS100.html) is really nice.
